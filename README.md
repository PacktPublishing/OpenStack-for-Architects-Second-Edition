# OpenStack for Architects - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [OpenStack for Architects - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/openstack-architects-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788624510), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Over the past 6 years, hundreds of organizations have successfully implemented Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms based on OpenStack. The huge amount of investment from these organizations, including industry giants such as IBM and HP, as well as open source leaders, such as Red Hat , Canonical, and SUSE, has led analysts to label OpenStack as the most important open source technology since the Linux operating system. Due to its ambitious scope, OpenStack is a complex and fast-evolving open source project that requires a diverse skill set to design and implement it.

OpenStack for Architects leads you through the major decision points that you'll face while architecting an OpenStack private cloud for your organization. This book will address the recent changes made in the latest OpenStack release and will also deal with advanced concepts such as containerization, NVF and security. At each point, the authors offer you advice based on the experience they've gained from designing and leading successful OpenStack projects in a wide range of industries. Each chapter also includes lab material that gives you a chance to install and configure the technologies used to build production-quality OpenStack clouds. Most importantly, the book focuses on ensuring that your OpenStack project meets the needs of your organization, which will guarantee a successful rollout.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
listen_tls = 1
listen_tcp = 0 
auth_tls = "none"
```

All the software used in the examples in this book is available at no cost on the internet.
Links are provided for each of the projects used. Many of the lab exercises require access to physical hardware or a virtualized environment for a lab. We recommend having at least 4 and up to 12 physical servers available for deploying OpenStack into production, depending on your requirements.
